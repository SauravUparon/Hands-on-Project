# Hands-on-Project-Spartificial-

This of Hands on Project did by me and their related code files are attached in this repository.
1. The first code file tells about the ML algorithms used for the predicting Quasar, stars, galaxies from the SDSS DR14 survey data-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucidlenn/sloan-digital-sky-survey
2. This second code file tells about the Neutron star modelling using Python.
3. The third code file tells about the exoplanet hunt using different ML models-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data
   The kaggle notebook where I did the model code-https://www.kaggle.com/code/iitm21f1000355/exoplanet-hunt-using-ml
